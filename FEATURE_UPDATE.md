# ArcGIS Map Component Feature Updates

## Overview
This document outlines the new features added to the ArcGIS Map component and related systems, including model file management and notification capabilities.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Notification System
A comprehensive notification system has been added to provide user feedback for various operations.

#### Components Added:
- **NotificationService** (`src/services/notificationService.ts`)
  - Singleton service for managing notifications
  - Support for different notification types: success, error, warning, info
  - Auto-dismiss functionality with configurable duration
  - Action buttons for interactive notifications
  - Subscription-based callback system

- **NotificationContainer** (`src/components/NotificationContainer.tsx`)
  - React component for displaying notifications
  - Animated slide-in notifications from the right
  - Progress bars for auto-dismiss notifications
  - Styled according to notification type
  - Dismiss functionality

#### Features:
- **Toast Notifications**: Non-intrusive notifications that appear in the top-right corner
- **Auto-dismiss**: Configurable auto-dismiss duration (default 5 seconds)
- **Persistent Notifications**: Error notifications persist until manually dismissed
- **Action Buttons**: Notifications can include action buttons for user interaction
- **Type-based Styling**: Different colors and icons for success, error, warning, and info

### 2. Model File Management
Enhanced file management capabilities for digital twin models.

#### Components Added:
- **FileManagementService** (`src/services/fileManagementService.ts`)
  - Download functionality for model files
  - Delete functionality with confirmation
  - Bulk operations support
  - File validation
  - File size formatting utilities

#### Features:
- **Download Models**: Download model files from both blob URLs and external URLs
- **Delete Models**: Delete models with confirmation dialog via notifications
- **Bulk Operations**: Support for bulk deletion of multiple models
- **File Validation**: Validate model data before operations
- **Progress Feedback**: User feedback through notifications for all operations

### 3. Updated Components

#### ModelLibrary Component Updates:
- Added `onModelDelete` prop for handling model deletion
- Implemented download and delete button functionality
- Integrated with notification system for user feedback
- Added proper error handling

#### ArcGIS Map Component Updates:
- Added `onModelDelete` prop support
- Integrated notification system for map initialization feedback
- Added model management handlers (download/delete)
- Enhanced error reporting with notifications

#### App Component Updates:
- Added `handleModelDelete` function
- Integrated NotificationContainer component
- Updated prop passing to child components
- Added test imports for development

## Usage Examples

### Using the Notification System
```typescript
import { notificationService } from '../services/notificationService';

// Success notification
notificationService.success('Success!', 'Operation completed successfully');

// Error notification (persistent)
notificationService.error('Error!', 'Something went wrong');

// Warning notification
notificationService.warning('Warning!', 'Please check your input');

// Info notification
notificationService.info('Info', 'Here is some information');

// Notification with action
notificationService.addNotification({
  type: 'warning',
  title: 'Confirm Action',
  message: 'Are you sure you want to proceed?',
  duration: 0,
  action: {
    label: 'Confirm',
    onClick: () => {
      // Handle confirmation
    }
  }
});
```

### Using File Management
```typescript
import { fileManagementService } from '../services/fileManagementService';

// Download a model
await fileManagementService.downloadModel(model);

// Delete a model with confirmation
await fileManagementService.deleteModel(model, (deletedModel) => {
  // Handle model deletion in your state
  setModels(prev => prev.filter(m => m.id !== deletedModel.id));
});

// Bulk delete models
await fileManagementService.bulkDeleteModels(selectedModels, (deletedModels) => {
  // Handle bulk deletion
});
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Upload a model** using the file upload feature
2. **Navigate to the Model Library** to see the uploaded models
3. **Test Download**: Click the download button on any model
4. **Test Delete**: Click the delete button and confirm deletion
5. **Test Notifications**: Observe notifications for all operations
6. **Test ArcGIS Map**: Navigate to the GIS view and observe initialization notifications

### Console Testing
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
// Test notifications
testNotifications();

// Test file management
testFileManagement();
```

## Technical Details

### Notification System Architecture
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures single instance of notification service
- **Observer Pattern**: Callback-based subscription system
- **React Hooks**: Uses useState and useEffect for component state management
- **CSS Animations**: Smooth slide-in animations with Tailwind CSS

### File Management Architecture
- **Promise-based API**: All operations return promises for proper async handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of blob URLs to prevent memory leaks
- **Validation**: Input validation before performing operations

### Integration Points
- **App Level**: NotificationContainer added at app level for global notifications
- **Service Level**: All services integrated with notification system
- **Component Level**: UI components use services for business logic

## Future Enhancements
1. **Notification Persistence**: Save notifications to localStorage
2. **Notification History**: View past notifications
3. **Batch Operations UI**: Enhanced UI for bulk operations
4. **File Preview**: Preview models before download
5. **Upload Progress**: Real-time upload progress notifications
6. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
